For the homework this week we will create the database and queries for an application we will continue working on in the node js class.

The application will be a meal sharing website, where users can book a reservation at a meal another user has created.

So as a user you can both

Create a new meal for people to join
Book a reservation at a meal
It will be kind of similar to this website: https://www.mealsharing.com/
